          <p>To find the perfect recipe, you first need the perfect ingredients. And that's what our founders Jisoo Geum and Julia Lee were for each other. In 2017, they joined forces, or better yet kitchens, to make buns for their friends and family. The buns they made were delicious, unlike anything anyone had tasted. As a result, their friends and family asked them to entertain more and more.</p>
          <p>They quickly realized this side project of theirs could be something more. There was a gap in the world for delicious buns, readily available, that didn't compromise on their ingredients. Real eggs, butter and cream cheese; nothing was too good to achieve perfection. And perfection is that decadent, slowly melting bite of buns we all know and love.</p>
          <p>Flash forward and the Bun Bun brand has grown citywide. Built on Jisoo and Julia’s vision, each bakery still has the warmth and nostalgia of its home-kitchen roots, but we also take a modern approach for the world today. So whether you're enjoying a Bun Bun or a Bunbun®, one thing is certain – perfection is all we offer.</p>
