*** Additional page I created was the "About" page. ***

Some of the extra code I had to learn for this project was creating Modals, Horizontal Scroll section in the Browse page, styling search bars and buttons, creating footers, and creating fixed navigation bar. 

****NOTE****

Hello, I have been having problems downloading Xcode due to low disk space-according to the error messages. After I purged many files, applications, and etc. I had about 40GB of space left, which should be enough to expand Xcode. However, the problem was still there. For this reason, I will upload my code and assets file as a ZIP. I think this might be the problem with my laptop since I've had issues where my laptop automatically restarts while using applications that can stress out the device (like Unity or Maya). I will try to figure this out soon but for now, this is my submission format. I apologize for the inconvenience :(
